# Col-Ordering Documentation 
Col-ordering was the first site scanned using OWASP Zap. 
The main goal was to test if the automated scans were able to pass through the login page to col-ordering. 
This scan has no notable alerts as most of the medium alerts were from the login page. 
The one medium alert that was found on col-ordering was a [Vulnerable JS Library](https://github.com/KellyTTan/Documentation/blob/main/invoice%20pre%20approval/documentation/median_vulnerabilities.md#m-vulnerable-js-library) (click on the link for more info on this vulnerability).
