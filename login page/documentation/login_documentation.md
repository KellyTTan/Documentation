# Login Documentation 
These OWASP Zap scans were one of the first scans performed on the site. 
These were test scans to check if the automated scans were able to gain authorized access into col-ordering.
Because the credientials were not configured properly, the scans weren't able to make it past the login page.
These reports were included anyways for documentation sake as login page scans. 
A tutorial was created on how to properly set up a profile with credentials are documentated in [Zap Scan Documentation](https://github.com/KellyTTan/Documentation/blob/main/login%20page/documentation/Zap_Scan_Documentation.pdf)
